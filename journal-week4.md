I started off by attempting my most loathed task, trying to get code to work. I did sucessfully georeference a 1965 aerial photo of the Saint Mary Anglican Church and its surroudning areas, adding 3 ground control points. It was hard to add anymore because although there were many more buildings such as farmhouses around the churches, these have all since vanished, becoming dense areas of trees. This is actually something I find interesting to look at on old aerial photos of Orleans. If a house is destroyed or abandoned, I suppose trees are wont to grow in the wood. So every time I see a dense area of trees today, I can probably assume a house was once there.

Anyways, I did try to put this code into first the index2.html file I made, following all the steps, with the exception that I changed the historical map layer to my own historical map and the coordinates to the coordinates of the church. Upon viewing this in my brower, I was met with a white screen. It didn't work. But at least it was not showing an error 404 anymore, so not a complete fail. Maybe just a three quarters fail.
I then for some reason tried to put bits of code from the index2.html file into the index.html file because I figured they could be compiled. It did not work, showing a white screen. I hope to get this to work by Friday.

CONSOLIDATION DOCUMENT

Although I think that I have had many wins so far in this course, the one I am most proud and surprised about is having the HTML code actually work to create a web map of my cemetery and gravestones. I honestly did not expect it to be that easy, and although at first it did not work because I was entering in the URL incorrectly, it was an easy fix and I was very surprised. Although I’ve tried coding many times, not exactly for archaeology, none of those attempts were technically successful, other than printing, say, “hello world”. I did feel this quote heavily when I was having issues with coding, and the overall unfamiliarity of computer language.

"Considerable issues have come up in digital archaeology with regard to access and inequality, deskilling, reproduction of corrosive and oppressive narratives of the past, boosting late capitalism and contributing toward the impact of climate change. I discuss these issues throughout the text, through the costs and affordances of digital archaeology." Morgan, Colleen. 2022. Current Digital Archaeology. Annual Review of Anthropology 51:215

Because I am in an arts degree, computer knowledge is kept to a bare minimum because of the connotation that computers are “scary” and “complicated” or any other negative adjective for that matter. I think this is certainly an issue and part of deliberate deskilling on the part of big tech. It also leads to inequality with respect to who knows how to code, not necessarily who has access to the tools they need to code. Someone in an engineering degree knows code far better than I do, why? Engineering could be done without coding, and that's how buildings were built in the past without computers. But coding is applied in engineering because it so vastly helps construct structures and cars and technology that it would be foolish to not use. Likewise, I think coding in archaeology is so useful that it is surprising that it is not being taught more. I firmly believe that we have to be pushed completely out of our comfort zones in order to reap the rewards of what we’re truly capable of, like exercising, or in this case learning a foreign language to talk to silicon.

The most difficult task so far has been trying to get the historical map overlay running on the web (or at least my network's web). Everything looks right in the code, there is no error 404, but it shows a white screen when I load it up. It is annoying too because I correctly georeferenced the aerial map I made, and uploaded it to Map Warper. I almost wish we were using ArcGIS for this project, because I have much more experience at that than HTML coding, but I suppose this will be helpful to know as well. I think I have also changed my outlook on coding breaking/not working too. Whereas before if code didn’t work I would completely give up (and actually in winter 2025 I dropped an intro to code class because one of my codes wasn’t working, an incredibly stupid decision) I am now determined to either find a solution, or move on and perhaps look back at it at the end of this semester. Maybe I’ll fix the code then in five minutes, and laugh at myself two months earlier. I am also starting to view code as closer to learning ancient Greek or Latin than math. Those two languages are very formulaic in nature, as I have learned, everything exists and is written for an explicit reason, be it grammar or emphasis or whatever else. Every line of code also exists for an explicit reason, if one line is missing it would mess up the whole code. Just like in Homer even if just one word in one line of poetry is missing, it would completely destroy the hexameter.

I think the most significant implication of digital archaeology is the ease with which your work can be disseminated to anyone with a phone, which is essentially everyone these days. This also comes with major responsibilities. Before cell phones, you would mostly get information from television and newspapers; television in general only brought on experts who knew what they were talking about, and likewise newspapers were written by people with facts and a background in the field they were writing about. I am sure you’ve seen this issue, and I may not even need to mention it, but in 2025 anyone with a phone has automatically become an expert in whatever they are talking about, and find it necessary to start a podcast. The true scale of misinformation and disinformation online is incomprehensible, that is why digital archaeologists must adhere to ethical standards. In my personal experience, I’ve been posted on Carleton social media pages and websites because of my Maurice Price Summer Research Internship work, much of which was digital archaeology. I realized that it was most important, when I had to write a summary of my research for everyone to read (not that everyone read it, but that anyone could access it), to keep the wording and terms in an easily explained and accessible format. I doubt anyone but archaeologists knows what spolia is, or that anyone but Hellenists knows where (or what even is) Mani. Tomorrow (Oct. 3) in fact, I am making a short video with FASS where I will talk about my excavation and survey experience over the summer in Greece, promoting the archaeology minor at Carleton. This is the digital archaeologists’ responsibility to the public. I am not going to talk like Zahi Hawass did on his Joe Rogan episode (although I might wear the Indiana Jones hat).

On the flip side, the digital archaeologist has an equal responsibility to whom they are studying. We cannot seek permission from the deceased to study their graves, they’re dead. But we can adhere to respectful practices that would minimize any possible offence. Among the most important is seeking permission from whoever is in charge of the cemetery to conduct in this case non-invasive archaeological work. They act as a voice for the deceased and from my experience were happy to help out (even offering me a tour of the interior of the church) and interested in what I was doing. Although I have to admit, their response is the colonial perspective of archaeology. I can think of two examples where a people would have been much more hesitant to help out for just reasons: some Indigenous groups and Greek people living in rural Greece. In the case of Indigenous people in Canada, colonists had destroyed their lives through residential schools, disease, neglect, the list goes on. So when an archaeologist (I think the discipline of archaeology is inherently colonial) comes and says they want to study Indigenous human remains, obviously this raises numerous red flags. This is especially also true in Greece as well, because the country is abounding in archaeological sites situated on land still owned by Greek families passed down from generations. When the Greek ministry of Culture is made aware of an archaeological site on someone's land, what usually happens is that the site and land around it is declared as Zone Alpha, an infamous term among vernacular Greeks. This designation means that the land is now property of the Greek government, and the original owners are no longer permitted to do anything on that land, be it farming or living. As a result, Greeks who come upon sites not known previously, are hesitant to report their findings, lest their livelihoods are stripped. The Greek government is also in no real position to financially compensate the land owners, because the government itself is also struggling economically.
	I probably went on longer than I needed to, but I just wanted to provide a glimpse into doing archaeology where it is not as easy going as this project was. There were relatively few ethical concerns in this project; for instance we were not exhuming any human remains and publishing pictures. I think this is also a big advantage of digital archaeology, through which we can gain very meaningful insights into past lives of people through minimally invasive procedures. This is a lot more inherently ethical.

So with respect to a digital archaeologist and his or her responsibility to ethics; it is a two-fold problem.

The digital archaeologist must consider the public and share the results of an archaeological study in an accessible, but also true, manner. It can’t be summarized to the point of missing important terms and definitions, but also cannot be so complicated that most of the public will not understand anything.
The digital archaeologist also has a responsibility to the people that are being studied, critically, these people cannot speak for themselves and what they would have wanted. Permission is always important, from a governing body, or in the case of Indigenous archaeology, Indigenous communities who have special ethics committees for non-Indigenous archaeologists.

I have integrated your coding feedback to successfully get the digital map working, as well as the minor error I made with kobotoolbox and the coordinate system. I have also gotten R successfully installed on my Macbook.

In terms of what I have actually done:
The readings and podcasts
Hypothesis and Discord working (although my issue with Discord still remains)
Jupyter installed and used successfully
Made a drawn map of my church and cemetery
Input information into Kobotoolbox, as well as making a better version of the kobotoolbox form for Canadian cemeteries
Created a webmap (no overlay yet)
Explored the introduction to spatial archaeology
Github repositories made with reading annotations, notes, etc.

I guess this is the part where I am supposed to suggest a grade for myself, which I have never been fond of because either think I deserve a higher grade than what you think, in which case I look like an idiot, or think I deserve a lower grade than what you think, also in which case I look like an idiot. So hopefully you’ll agree with me. I think an A would be a fair grade (is it just A, B, C, D, i.e. how would one get an A+ in this class?). I’ll break down why below:

Analytical ability:

	I think I have demonstrated analytical ability throughout the first four weeks of this course. I have read the readings and annotated the parts which I felt especially relevant to the course work. Additionally, I did use code to a decent amount of success and for once truly understood what each line of code was doing; I was able to deconstruct the code into chunks that all came together.

Methodology:

	Pretty early on, I selected the cemetery I wanted to do and considered its feasibility. I figured that it would have a few older gravestones, and when I heard back that I only needed to do five, then I knew this would be perfect for me. It was close to my house and has genuinely been significant to my feeling of belonging and community in Orleans. I then sought permission, reaching out to another Anglican church who accepted my request. I picked a day that would be appropriate to go out to the cemetery, phone, compass, and measuring tape in hand, and successfully collected the data, one stone by one. 

Collaboration:
	Look, I know I haven’t actually used Discord at all, and for some reason it still is not letting me log in with either my personal or Carleton accounts. I might try to make a new gmail account, if I am able. I could have more to say here, but I have been in contact with you throughout the duration of these four weeks (I mean Dr. Graham, if Aasiyah is reading this) asking questions and heeding feedback. 

Argumentation:

I think I have successfully argued the importance and many ethical concerns behind doing digital archaeology not only in this document but previous weeks’ journal entries as well. I have considered my own encounters with emotional experiences in cemeteries or with artefacts which have a mortuary use/characteristics. 

Professionalization:

What is it meant by professionalization? Professionalization is different from professionalism. I read that it is “to give a professional character to”. Have I become a more professional archaeologist in the past four weeks? I suppose I have: I talked to members of the public in order to seek permission to conduct real archaeological work on a real site with real implications. I used code to demonstrate some of my research. I considered the implications of my research. I think I am more professionalized as opposed to when I began this course and as opposed to if I were taking a class where I’d be staring at slides of sites all day.
